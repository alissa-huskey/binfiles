> Handy scripts I keep around.

This is a collection of trivial utility scripts that I keep in a `bin`
directory that's in my path.

I use most of these frequently so they're pretty well broken in. However
they're only intended for my personal use and there's no telling what might
happen in different environments. But y'know, feel free to try.
